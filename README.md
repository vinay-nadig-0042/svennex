# Svennex

Open source & self hostable alternative to [Dockerhub Automated Builds](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/). Svennex aims to support all major code repositories(Github, Gitlab etc) and all major docker registries(DockerHub, AWS ECR, GCR, Gitlab Registry etc).

**Note:** Svennex is still in **alpha** stage of development. There might be breaking changes in the future.

### Getting Started

You will need the following components ready before deploying Svennex.

1. **Github OAuth Application**: A Github OAuth Application that will allow Svennex to access Github Repositories. Follow instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app) to create one and copy the Client ID & Client Secret. Provide `https://<FQDN>/oauth/github/callback` as the callback url where FQDN is the domain name where you will access Svennex.
2. **Gitlab OAuth Application**: A Gitlab OAuth Application that will allow Svennex to access Gitlab Repositories. Follow instructions [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth_provider.html) to create one an copy the Client ID & Client secret. Provide `https://<FQDN>/oauth/gitlab/callback` as the callback url where FQDN is the domain name where you will access Svennex.
3. **SSH Key**: Create or Import a Key Pair into the AWS account in the region where you are deploying Svennex.
4. **FQDN**: You will need a domain name to point to Svennex once it's deployed. You can either use a subdomain or a root domain. Once you have deployed Svennex, you will have to update the DNS record to point to the EC2 Instance's IP address.
5. **SMTP Config**: You will need a SMTP interface to send transactional emails(Sign Up confirmation, Password Reset etc). You can either use SendGrid/AWS SES for this. Copy the username, password, SMTP domain, SMTP Address & Port. Sendgrid's free tier works nicely and you can find the documenation [here](https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/sending-email/rubyonrails)

Once you have these components ready, you can move on to the deployment.

### Deployment

One click deploy to AWS with Cloudformation.

**Note:** This template is built for **convenience & speed** rather than security. A production ready template is in the pipeline. 

It deploys the following components.

1. VPC
2. 2 Public Subnets
3. NAT Gateway
4. RDS Instance
5. Elasticache Redis Instance
6. EC2 Instance
